      <p>I like listening to music all the time. It helps me relax and makes everything more fun. I love spending time with my friends, swimming, and going on little adventures with them. But most of all, I absolutely love learning choreography and dancing, especially when I get to perform on stage. There’s something special about expressing myself through dance. I also enjoy watching series in my free time, It's my way of escaping into new stories and characters. Going to concerts of my favorite singers and groups is one of the best feelings ever, and I love collecting their albums too. The designs, photocards, and songs are all so special to me. I also enjoy traveling and exploring new places with my family. Trying new foods, seeing different cultures, and making memories is so exciting. I dream of traveling to Thailand one day. Overall, I’m a fun, creative, and passionate person.

      <a href="/Maya.html" aria-current="page">Maya</a> 
      <p>I like to watch TV, cook, go shopping, read, and   and go out with my friends. When I cook I always or mostly I cook sweets or desserts. I really like to make cookies or macarons. I can cook alone because my mom doesnt let me put the stove on, but the rest of the cooking I do. The things I like about going out with my friends are making sleepovers with them, talking, taking fotos, and also we dress up sometimes but not really, then we love going to the mall the next day. We also play games and take videos about it. When I am watching TV I like to watch dramas, suspense/terror, action series or movies, but I prefer series because I can watch something for a long period of time. With reading I like to read romance because I really enjoy the emotions that are in the book. I like to post-its to mark important things that happen in the book.
