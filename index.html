      <p>I like listening to music all the time. It helps me relax and makes everything more fun. I love spending time with my friends, swimming, and going on little adventures with them. But most of all, I absolutely love learning choreography and dancing, especially when I get to perform on stage. There’s something special about expressing myself through dance. I also enjoy watching series in my free time, It's my way of escaping into new stories and characters. Going to concerts of my favorite singers and groups is one of the best feelings ever, and I love collecting their albums too. The designs, photocards, and songs are all so special to me. I also enjoy traveling and exploring new places with my family. Trying new foods, seeing different cultures, and making memories is so exciting. I dream of traveling to Thailand one day. Overall, I’m a fun, creative, and passionate person.
